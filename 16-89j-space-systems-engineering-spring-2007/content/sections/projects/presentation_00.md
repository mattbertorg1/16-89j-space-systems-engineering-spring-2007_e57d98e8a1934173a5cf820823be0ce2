description: 'Example of student work: Presentation on project to establish an enabling
  space infrastructure that will support the exploration of Mars. The Mars infrastructure
  will enhance the capabilities of future robotic missions while significantly reducing
  their cost. This magnification of capability will provide improved opportunities
  for international cooperation as well as increasing public awareness and involvement
  in Mars exploration. Ultimately, the Mars infrastructure will be a key enabler for
  establishing a human presence on Mars.'
