description: 'Example of student work: final design report on project to establish
  an enabling space infrastructure that will support the exploration of Mars. The
  Mars infrastructure will enhance the capabilities of future robotic missions while
  significantly reducing their cost. This magnification of capability will provide
  improved opportunities for international cooperation as well as increasing public
  awareness and involvement in Mars exploration. Ultimately, the Mars infrastructure
  will be a key enabler for establishing a human presence on Mars.'
