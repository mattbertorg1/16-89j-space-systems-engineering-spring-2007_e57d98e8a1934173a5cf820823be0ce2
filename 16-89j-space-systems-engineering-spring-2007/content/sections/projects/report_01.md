description: 'Example of student work: final design report on a swarm-based space
  system. The purpose of this document is to describe and summarize the process completed
  and results obtained by the 16.89 class during the spring semester of 2001. The
  class addressed the design of a swarm-based space system, B-TOS, to provide data
  for evaluation and short-term forecasting of space weather. The primary stakeholders
  and participants of the project are: 16.89 students, faculty and staff, and the
  Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). Furthermore, the Space Policy and Architecture
  Research Center (SSPARC) is also interested in seeing the implementation of the
  Multi-Attribute Utility Analysis (MAUA) for a real space system.'
