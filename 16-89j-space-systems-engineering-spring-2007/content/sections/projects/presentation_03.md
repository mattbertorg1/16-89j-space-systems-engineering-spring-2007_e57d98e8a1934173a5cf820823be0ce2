description: 'Example of student work: project presentation on rapid modeling of Mars
  robotic explorers. The Rapid Modeling of Mars Robotic Explorers project is motivated
  by the need to evaluate and compare rover architectures and designs for future unmanned
  Mars missions. The software tool developed by this project can compare costs and
  benefits over a large space of rover architectures by varying mission science and
  design parameters. Future missions, including the 2009 Mars Science Laboratory (MSL),
  can benefit from the trade space analysis provided by this tool.'
